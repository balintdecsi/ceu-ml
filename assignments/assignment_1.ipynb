    "We would have no chance to estimate any model on these 1,000 features. However, we could reduce the dimensionality with PCA. Then, we could look at the relation of the first few principal components (that captures part of the variance of all 1,000 features) and the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that as we only have 40 observations we can only define a subspace with at most 39 dimensions. Think of it like trying to define a volume in 3D space using only 2 points - you can only define a line, not a full 3D space. Technically, the sklearn PCA implementation will result in 40 components, but the last one will have a variance of 0."
